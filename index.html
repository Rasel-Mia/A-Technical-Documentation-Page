        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions/methods) that can be applied to the data structure.
		
		In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.</p>
		<p>One of the principal advantages of object-oriented programming techniques over procedural programming techniques is that they enable programmers to create modules that do not need to be changed when a new type of object is added. A programmer can simply create a new object that inherits many of its features from existing objects. This makes object-oriented programs easier to modify.</P>
		<p>Object Oriented programming is a programming style, which combines data and action together. The Object Oriented programming paradigm plays an important role in human computer interface. It has different components that takes real world objects and performs actions on them, making live interactions between man and the machine.<p>
        <h2>Common Uses</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Re-usability thats mean reusing some facilities rather building it again and again. This is done with the use of a class. We can use it ‘n’ number of times as per our need</li>
          <li>Data redundancy this is a condition created at the place of data storage (you can say Databases)where the same piece of data is held in two separate places. So the data redundancy is one of the greatest advantages of OOP. If a user wants a similar functionality in multiple classes he/she can go ahead by writing common class definitions for the similar functionalities and inherit them.</li>
          <li>Code maintanance this feature is more of a necessity for any programming languages, it helps users from doing re-work in many ways. It is always easy and time-saving to maintain and modify the existing codes with incorporating new changes into it.</li>
          <li>With the use of data hiding and abstraction mechanism, we are filtering out limited data to exposure which means we are maintaining security and providing necessary data to view.</li>
          <li>If you are practicing on OOPs the design benefit a user will get is in terms of designing and fixing things easily and eliminating the risks (if any). Here the Object Oriented Programs forces the designers to have a longer and extensive design phase, which results in better designs and fewer flaws. After a time when the program has reached some critical limits, it is easier to program all the non-OOP’s one separately.</p></li>
          <li>It helps to reduce the complexity and also improves the maintainability of the system. When combined with the concepts of the Encapsulation and Polymorphism, Abstraction gives more power to the Object oriented programming languages.</li>

      <header id="inheritance">
        <h1>Inheritance</h1>
        <p>One object acquires the properties and behaviors of the parent object.</p>
		<p>The mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) from existing ones (super class or base class) and forming them into a hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance (a "child object") acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object (except: constructors, destructor, overloaded operators and friend functions of the base class). Inheritance allows programmers to create classes that are built upon existing classes, to specify a new implementation while maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through inheritance give rise to a directed graph. Inheritance was invented in 1969 for Simula.</p>

      <header id="polymorphism">
        <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
        <p>Many forms. One task is performed by different ways.The concept that objects of different types can be accessed through the same interface. Each type can provide its own, independent implementation of this interface. It is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming.</p>
       
        <ul>
		 <h2>Method Overloading:</h2>
          <li>A type of polymorphism. It has several names like "Compile Time Polymorphism" or "Static Polymorphism" or "Early Binding". Method overloading means creating multiple methods in a class with same names but different signatures.</li>
		  <h2>Method Overriding</h2>
          <li>A type of polymorphism. It has several names like "Run Time Polymorphism" or "Dynamic Polymorphism" or "Late Binding". Methot overloading means having two methods with same name and same signatures, one should be in the base class and other method should be in a derived class.</li>

        <h1>Abstruction</h1>
        <p>Abstraction (from the Latin abs, meaning away from and trahere, meaning to draw) is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics. In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. In the same way that abstraction sometimes works in art, the object that remains is a representation of the original, with unwanted detail omitted. The resulting object itself can be referred to as an abstraction, meaning a named entity made up of selected attributes and behavior specific to a particular usage of the originating entity. Abstraction is related to both encapsulation and data hiding.</p>

      <header id="encapsulation">
        <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
        <p>The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them. Publicly accessible methods are generally provided in the class (getters and setters) to access the values, and other client classes call these methods to retrieve and modify the values within the object.</p>
